# Ansible-Slurp-Example
## What is this?
An example Ansible slurp playbook to pull remote variables to the current playbook run.

## Why this?
Sometimes I want to update options or variables that trigger playbook roles that are automaticlly applied/run. I like to think of this may be useful for allowing a app owner to allow infra to gather information and automate communication of results and post work actions.
